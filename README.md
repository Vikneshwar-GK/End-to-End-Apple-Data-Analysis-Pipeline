# End-to-End-Apple-Data-Analysis-Pipeline

This repository contains an end-to-end Big Data Engineering Project that demonstrates building a scalable and efficient data pipeline for analyzing Apple-related data using Apache Spark and Databricks.

The project provides a real-world implementation of a data engineering workflow, including data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), while leveraging modern big data technologies like Delta Lake and columnar file formats (Parquet and ORC) for optimal performance.
